[Setting up a NIP-05 identifier](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md)

[Setting up GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

Some notes about getting this published using GitHub pages:

- Your repository must be called `yourusername.github.io` otherwise the Url it will generate will be `yourusername.github.io/repository_name`.
- Use "GitHub Actions" rather than "Deploy from a branch" and "Static HTML".
- GitHub web page hosting is case-sensitive.

My NIP-05 identifier for ben@bengweeks.github.io can be seen here:

[https://bengweeks.github.io/.well-known/nostr.json?name=ben](https://bengweeks.github.io/.well-known/nostr.json?name=ben)

Using a client such as [https://astral.ninja](https://astral.ninja), enter your NIP-05 identifier into your profile settings in the form of `ben@bengweeks.github.io`.
